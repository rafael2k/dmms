Developers TODO list: [#bugzilla id]
====================================

* Move all the streaming code out of the mpg123 plugin and into libxmms,
  pave the way to having more input plugins supporting streaming media
  (preferably without needing to know about the transport medium- ftp/http
  etc).

* Add a dir browser to the skins dialog so users don't have to add
  SKINSDIR variable. Instead use a file dialog and save the skin
  dirs in the ~/.xmms/config file.

* Ability to load playlists without the .m3u extension at startup
  eg. xmms -pl playlistname

* Add a new enqueue function to XMMS from the command line, -ep, which 
  enqueues the file and plays it.

* Shortkey/menu item to open currently used input plugin preferences.
  Maybe one key for each type of plugin?

* Parse dirs in m3u files to load all files in that dir (recursive?) when
  XMMS loads the playlist. [#82]
  
* Parse m3u files in m3u files (protect against endless recursion?) [#262]  

* Read playlists from http [#125]

* Seeking in streams [#296/#311]
